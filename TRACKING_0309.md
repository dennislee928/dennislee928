Vulnerability assessments - identifying outcomes	Domain 6: Security Assessment & Testing	Risk & Vulnerability Management
2. Study Priorities

Since you missed multiple questions across different domains, hereâ€™s a priority ranking for your study focus (1 = High priority, 3 = Low priority):
Domain	Priority Level	Reasoning
Domain 5: Security Operations & Administration	1 (High)	Most missed questions fell into this domain (DRP, BCP, job rotation, physical security, backups, etc.)
Domain 6: Security Assessment & Testing	1 (High)	Missed multiple questions on penetration testing, auditing, and vulnerability assessments.
Domain 1: Access Controls	2 (Medium)	Several questions on authentication, SSO, and RBAC were incorrect.
Domain 7: Systems & Application Security	2 (Medium)	Secure software development, database security, and intrusion detection were weak areas.
Domain 4: Network & Communications Security	3 (Low-Medium)	A few mistakes on IPsec, network addressing, and cabling.
Domain 3: Risk Identification, Monitoring & Analysis	3 (Low-Medium)	Cryptography, risk modeling, and CMM were areas of struggle.
Domain 2: Security Operations & Administration	3 (Low)	Fewer mistakes here, mostly around buffer overflows and coding errors.

ðŸ“Œ Focus first on:
âœ… Security Operations & Administration (Domain 5)
âœ… Security Assessment & Testing (Domain 6)
âœ… Access Controls (Domain 1)
Then move to Systems & Application Security (Domain 7) before covering Networking & Risk domains.

---

## Overview:

- Monitoring involves observing known subjects, like:
- system
- endpoints
- users
- network traffic flow

---

## 3.4.1 Source Sys:

### - Any system with data traversing(passing through), will be considered as part in the scope of risk assesments.

### - Source Sys can be divided into 4 categories:

#### -1._Applications_:

##### ex: SaaS/CRM/ERP/EIP.

#### -2._Security Appliances_:

##### def: hardware/virtual devices provding security protection/visability/monitoring capabilities.

##### ex:firewalls/IDS(Intrution Defense System)/IPS(Intrution Prevention System)/SIEM(Security Information & Event Management )

#### -3._Network devices_:

##### ex:routers/switches/access points/ network between systems.

#### -4._Hosts_:

##### def: typically end-point users' device suck as work station/ mobile devices, usually carries sensetive data like physical/ digital finger-prints.

## 3.4.1.A Data Sources for risk management:

### Data works better for fitting the needs in risk management framework , including abstraction/details/period.

### For instance:

#### - Risk assessment must understand persistent, long-term risks, and be able to correlate their potential impacts and frequency of occurrence to the organization’s strategic (long-term) and tactical (near-term) goals and objectives. Time periods tend to be measured in weeks or months, for example.

#### - Risk response takes specific types of attacks and chooses controls based on the technical, operational, and other characteristics of the attack as a pattern, given the details of the organization’s existing or planned information systems, its technologies, and operational procedures. Time periods studied may minutes to hours or days to make practical choices between alternative control strategies.

#### - Risk monitoring must sound the alarm when an attack on the organization’s information and information systems is suspected, or within a short period of time after such an attack. Time periods can be as small as milliseconds.

---

## 3.4.1.B Risk Assessment: Data Sources:

### 2 Dimensions:

#### - Stratagic level

##### - Broadly considers the organization, its goals and objectives

##### - Markets or environments it operates in

##### - The threats it may face at that level.

##### - The organization’s strategic and tactical planning efforts should have assembled a rich set of data, which together with those plans identifies the critical business processes and assets that must be protected.

##### - Typically, these are documented in a business impact analysis (BIA) report.

#### - Lower level

##### - risk assessment draws on current business operational data

##### - Including security-related data, to identify potential, emerging, or yet overlooked sources of risks.

##### - Trending data related to information security risks, either regional or industry-wide in focus, can also feed the risk assessment process.

##### - This data tends to be aggregated at monthly or annual levels.

---

## 3.4.1.C Risk Response: Data Sources:

Choosing to treat a risk may involve selecting controls to detect the occurrence of a risk event

### - Preventing damage or compromise to information and information systems,

### - Alert security personnel to the event and facilitate taking corrective actions.

### - Decisions about risk treatment may require in-depth knowledge of both the systems being protected and the types of attacks that might occur.

### - Some of this data is available from published sources of CVE data, while other data will come from the organization’s own systems.

### - In some cases, selecting the right controls may require detailed simulation of different control approaches and attack scenarios(may involved ethical penetration testing).

### - Generating datas in mb,gb to tb, thus needs analysis.

### including

#### - imminent(cannot be wait) attack operations alerting to security personeel.

#### - Monitoring sys often use data sources such as:

##### - System and applications' logons(status of users or devices logged in and activities traces) to servers and endpoints.

##### - Network infra devices.

##### - Security devices , sensors, and systems(like firewalls, SI&E(event)M,IDS(Intrution Defense System),IPS(Intrution Prevention System),ID(Intrution Detection))

##### - Managed security services systems.

##### - Cloud and information service providers(ISPs), or 3rd party brokers/providers.

##### - Access control sys.

##### - Network traffic monitoring systems.

##### - DLP.

##### - UEBA(User & Entity Behavior Analytistics) systems.

##### - Users feedback gathered from IT-helpdesk/questioneer/queries.

##### - System maintence and diagnostic logs/utilization/chargeback reporting systems.

##### - Mobile devices management system.

##### - IT support system(power conditioning, environmental control(like security guard),fire detection+suppersion(termination or make it smaller))

##### - Physical security sensors and management system.

##### - RFID(Radio Frequency Information Detection) - for monitoring wi-fi,bluetooth, and mobile phone useages.

## 3.4.1.D Monitor Risk:

### - The fourth step in the risk management process is to monitor risk

### - involves both monitoring the potential causes of the risk and the controls or responses that the

### -organization has put in place to deal with it.

### - Risk changes as new vulnerabilities are discovered, new threats emerge, asset values change, laws or regulations change and management’s attitude toward risk changes. What was previously an acceptable level of risk may not be acceptable in the future.

### - When the risk response effort implements controls to reduce risk, it is also necessary to put in place the ability to monitor the controls to ensure they are working.

---

## 3.4.1.D Needs of Monitoring:

### - two purposes:

#### -1. To confirm risks' mitigation and control decisions are working.

#### -2. To detect and respond to attacks.

#### Risk response is based managements' direction and acceptance of risks.

#### Risk management is a life cycle, which is a continuous process.

### - During the monitoring phase, these will occur:

#### - Evaluate the effectiveness of the controls.

#### - Watch for changes in risk.

##### - Asset value

##### - New threats

##### - New vulnerabilities

##### - New legislation

#### - Report (communicate) risk levels to management.

#### - Comply with legal reporting requirements.

#### - Support audit.

#### - Trigger a new risk assessment when necessary.

## 3.4.1.D DLP:

### - DLP(Data Loss Protection/Data leakage prevention) is a technology that monitors and controls the flow of data across an organization's network and systems to prevent unauthorized access, data leakage, and data loss.

### - DLP is a key component of an organization's overall data security strategy, helping to protect sensitive information from theft, loss, or misuse.

### - For those hybrid cloud users or those utilizing cloud-based services partially within their organizations, it would be beneficial to ensure that DLP is understood and is appropriately structured across both cloud and non-cloud environments. Failure to do so can result in segmented and nonstandardized levels of security, which leads to increased risks.

### - DLP Components:

#### - Discovery and classification. As the first stage of a DLP implementation is an ongoing process, the majority of cloud-based DLP technologies are predominantly focused on this component.

#### - Monitoring. Data usage monitoring forms the key function of DLP. Effective DLP strategies monitor the usage of data across locations and platforms while enabling administrators to define one or more usage policies. The ability to monitor data can be executed on gateways, servers, and storage, as well as workstations and endpoint devices. Recently, the increased adoption of external services to assist with DLP as a service has increased, along with many cloud-based DLP solutions.

#### - Enforcement. Upon a violation of policy being detected, specified relevant enforcement actions can automatically be performed. Enforcement options can include the ability to alert and log, block data transfers or reroute them for additional confirmation, or encrypt the data prior to leaving the organizational boundaries.

### - DLP Architecture:

#### - DLP implementations typically conform to the following topographies:

##### - Network-based. Also referred to as gateway DLP. In this topography, the monitoring engine is deployed near the organizational gateway to monitor outgoing protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS/SMTP and FTP. The topography can be a mixture of proxy-based, bridge, network-tapping, or SMTP relays. This set up may require SSL interception for encrypted traffic.

##### - Storage-based. Sometimes referred to as server-based. In this topography, the DLP engine is installed where the data is at rest, usually in one or more storage subsystems and file and application servers. This is effective for data discovery and tracking usage but typically requires integration with network or endpoint-based DLP for policy enforcement.

##### - Client-based. The DLP application is installed on a user’s workstations and endpoint devices where data is at rest. This topography offers insights into how the data is used by users, with the ability to add additional protection that network DLP may not be able to provide. The challenge with client-based DLP is the complexity, time, and resources to implement across all endpoint devices.

## 3.4.1.E IP Flow:

### - IP flow is a method of monitoring network traffic by analyzing the flow of IP packets between two points on a network.

### - It involves capturing and analyzing the data packets that pass through a network device, such as a router or switch, to determine the direction and path of the traffic.

## 3.4.1.E IP Packet:

### - IP packet is a unit of data that is sent over a network, such as the internet or a local area network (LAN).

### - It is the smallest unit of data that can be sent over a network and is used to transport data from one device to another.

#### - IP source address

#### - IP destination address

#### - Source port

#### - Destination port

#### - Layer 3 protocol type

#### - Class of service

#### - Router or switch interface

### NetFlow groups all packets with the same source/destination IP address, source/destination ports, protocol interface, and class of service into a flow; it then tallies the packets and bytes. Because a large amount of network information is condensed into a database of NetFlow information (the NetFlow cache), this method of fingerprinting or determining a flow is scalable.

---

## 3.4.1.F Network Behavior Analysis:

### - Network behavior analysis (NBA) is a technique used to monitor and analyze network traffic to detect anomalies or suspicious activity.

### - It involves collecting network traffic data, analyzing it for patterns and anomalies, and then taking appropriate action based on the analysis.

#### - Source address pinpoints the origin of the traffic.

#### - Destination address points out who is receiving the traffic.

#### - Ports characterize the application utilizing the traffic.

#### - Class of service examines the priority of the traffic.

#### - The device interface reveals how traffic is utilized by the network device.

#### - Tallied packets and bytes show the amount of traffic.

---

## 3.4.1.G Full Packet Capture:

### - Full packet capture (FPC) is a technique used to capture and analyze all the data in a network packet, including the header, payload, and any associated metadata.

### - It involves capturing the entire packet, including the source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocol types, and other relevant information.

### - FPC is used to capture and analyze network traffic for a variety of purposes, including network troubleshooting, security monitoring, and performance analysis.

### -Most, if not all, are not IDS or IPS systems. Additionally, they may not include the native ability to break encrypted transmissions such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) communications.

---

## 3.4.1.H Incident Detection:

### - Incident detection is the process of identifying and responding to security incidents in real-time.

### - It involves monitoring network traffic, system logs, and other sources of data to detect suspicious activity or potential threats.

### - Incident detection is a critical component of an organization's overall security strategy, helping to protect against cyber attacks and other security threats.

---

## 3.4.1.I Monitoring: Strategies, tactical , and operational:

### -Strategic. These are high-leverage and typically high-value opportunities, objectives, and goals, normally involving time frames of months to years.

### - Tactical. This is the middleware of planning and decision-making, where objectives turn into plans and timeframes become more granular.

### - Operational. This is the step-by-step use of tools, processes, and technologies to create value by carrying out business processes, such as manufacturing, sales or service delivery.

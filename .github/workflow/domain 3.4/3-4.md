---

## Overview:

- Monitoring involves observing known subjects, like:
- system
- endpoints
- users
- network traffic flow

---

## 3.4.1 Source Sys:

### - Any system with data traversing(passing through), will be considered as part in the scope of risk assesments.

### - Source Sys can be divided into 4 categories:

#### -1._Applications_:

##### ex: SaaS/CRM/ERP/EIP.

#### -2._Security Appliances_:

##### def: hardware/virtual devices provding security protection/visability/monitoring capabilities.

##### ex:firewalls/IDS(Intrution Defense System)/IPS(Intrution Prevention System)/SIEM(Security Information & Event Management )

#### -3._Network devices_:

##### ex:routers/switches/access points/ network between systems.

#### -4._Hosts_:

##### def: typically end-point users' device suck as work station/ mobile devices, usually carries sensetive data like physical/ digital finger-prints.

---

## 3.4.1.A Data Sources for risk management:

### Data works better for fitting the needs in risk management framework , including abstraction/details/period.

### For instance:

#### - Risk assessment must understand persistent, long-term risks, and be able to correlate their potential impacts and frequency of occurrence to the organization’s strategic (long-term) and tactical (near-term) goals and objectives. Time periods tend to be measured in weeks or months, for example.

#### - Risk response takes specific types of attacks and chooses controls based on the technical, operational, and other characteristics of the attack as a pattern, given the details of the organization’s existing or planned information systems, its technologies, and operational procedures. Time periods studied may minutes to hours or days to make practical choices between alternative control strategies.

#### - Risk monitoring must sound the alarm when an attack on the organization’s information and information systems is suspected, or within a short period of time after such an attack. Time periods can be as small as milliseconds.

---

## 3.4.1.B Risk Assessment: Data Sources:

### 2 Dimensions:

#### - Stratagic level

##### - Broadly considers the organization, its goals and objectives

##### - Markets or environments it operates in

##### - The threats it may face at that level.

##### - The organization’s strategic and tactical planning efforts should have assembled a rich set of data, which together with those plans identifies the critical business processes and assets that must be protected.

##### - Typically, these are documented in a business impact analysis (BIA) report.

#### - Lower level

##### - risk assessment draws on current business operational data

##### - Including security-related data, to identify potential, emerging, or yet overlooked sources of risks.

##### - Trending data related to information security risks, either regional or industry-wide in focus, can also feed the risk assessment process.

##### - This data tends to be aggregated at monthly or annual levels.

---

## 3.4.1.C Risk Response: Data Sources:

Choosing to treat a risk may involve selecting controls to detect the occurrence of a risk event

### - Preventing damage or compromise to information and information systems,

### - Alert security personnel to the event and facilitate taking corrective actions.

### - Decisions about risk treatment may require in-depth knowledge of both the systems being protected and the types of attacks that might occur.

### - Some of this data is available from published sources of CVE data, while other data will come from the organization’s own systems.

### - In some cases, selecting the right controls may require detailed simulation of different control approaches and attack scenarios(may involved ethical penetration testing).

### - Generating datas in mb,gb to tb, thus needs analysis.

### including

#### - imminent(cannot be wait) attack operations alerting to security personeel.

#### - Monitoring sys often use data sources such as:

##### - System and applications' logons(status of users or devices logged in and activities traces) to servers and endpoints.

##### - Network infra devices.

##### - Security devices , sensors, and systems(like firewalls, SI&E(event)M,IDS(Intrution Defense System),IPS(Intrution Prevention System),ID(Intrution Detection))

##### - Managed security services systems.

##### - Cloud and information service providers(ISPs), or 3rd party brokers/providers.

##### - Access control sys.

##### - Network traffic monitoring systems.

##### - DLP.

##### - UEBA(User & Entity Behavior Analytistics) systems.

##### - Users feedback gathered from IT-helpdesk/questioneer/queries.

##### - System maintence and diagnostic logs/utilization/chargeback reporting systems.

##### - Mobile devices management system.

##### - IT support system(power conditioning, environmental control(like security guard),fire detection+suppersion(termination or make it smaller))

##### - Physical security sensors and management system.

##### - RFID(Radio Frequency Information Detection) - for monitoring wi-fi,bluetooth, and mobile phone useages.

## 3.4.1.D Monitor Risk:

### - The fourth step in the risk management process is to monitor risk

### - involves both monitoring the potential causes of the risk and the controls or responses that the

### -organization has put in place to deal with it.

### - Risk changes as new vulnerabilities are discovered, new threats emerge, asset values change, laws or regulations change and management’s attitude toward risk changes. What was previously an acceptable level of risk may not be acceptable in the future.

### - When the risk response effort implements controls to reduce risk, it is also necessary to put in place the ability to monitor the controls to ensure they are working.

---

## 3.4.1.D Needs of Monitoring:

### - two purposes:

#### -1. To confirm risks' mitigation and control decisions are working.

#### -2. To detect and respond to attacks.

#### Risk response is based managements' direction and acceptance of risks.

#### Risk management is a life cycle, which is a continuous process.

### - During the monitoring phase, these will occur:

#### - Evaluate the effectiveness of the controls.

#### - Watch for changes in risk.

##### - Asset value

##### - New threats

##### - New vulnerabilities

##### - New legislation

#### - Report (communicate) risk levels to management.

#### - Comply with legal reporting requirements.

#### - Support audit.

#### - Trigger a new risk assessment when necessary.

---

---

## 3.4.1.D DLP:

### - DLP(Data Loss Protection/Data leakage prevention) is a technology that monitors and controls the flow of data across an organization's network and systems to prevent unauthorized access, data leakage, and data loss.

### - DLP is a key component of an organization's overall data security strategy, helping to protect sensitive information from theft, loss, or misuse.

### - For those hybrid cloud users or those utilizing cloud-based services partially within their organizations, it would be beneficial to ensure that DLP is understood and is appropriately structured across both cloud and non-cloud environments. Failure to do so can result in segmented and nonstandardized levels of security, which leads to increased risks.

### - DLP Components:

#### - Discovery and classification. As the first stage of a DLP implementation is an ongoing process, the majority of cloud-based DLP technologies are predominantly focused on this component.

#### - Monitoring. Data usage monitoring forms the key function of DLP. Effective DLP strategies monitor the usage of data across locations and platforms while enabling administrators to define one or more usage policies. The ability to monitor data can be executed on gateways, servers, and storage, as well as workstations and endpoint devices. Recently, the increased adoption of external services to assist with DLP as a service has increased, along with many cloud-based DLP solutions.

#### - Enforcement. Upon a violation of policy being detected, specified relevant enforcement actions can automatically be performed. Enforcement options can include the ability to alert and log, block data transfers or reroute them for additional confirmation, or encrypt the data prior to leaving the organizational boundaries.

### - DLP Architecture:

#### - DLP implementations typically conform to the following topographies:

##### - Network-based. Also referred to as gateway DLP. In this topography, the monitoring engine is deployed near the organizational gateway to monitor outgoing protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS/SMTP and FTP. The topography can be a mixture of proxy-based, bridge, network-tapping, or SMTP relays. This set up may require SSL interception for encrypted traffic.

##### - Storage-based. Sometimes referred to as server-based. In this topography, the DLP engine is installed where the data is at rest, usually in one or more storage subsystems and file and application servers. This is effective for data discovery and tracking usage but typically requires integration with network or endpoint-based DLP for policy enforcement.

##### - Client-based. The DLP application is installed on a user’s workstations and endpoint devices where data is at rest. This topography offers insights into how the data is used by users, with the ability to add additional protection that network DLP may not be able to provide. The challenge with client-based DLP is the complexity, time, and resources to implement across all endpoint devices.

## 3.4.1.E IP Flow:

### - IP flow is a method of monitoring network traffic by analyzing the flow of IP packets between two points on a network.

### - It involves capturing and analyzing the data packets that pass through a network device, such as a router or switch, to determine the direction and path of the traffic.

## 3.4.1.E IP Packet:

### - IP packet is a unit of data that is sent over a network, such as the internet or a local area network (LAN).

### - It is the smallest unit of data that can be sent over a network and is used to transport data from one device to another.

#### - IP source address

#### - IP destination address

#### - Source port

#### - Destination port

#### - Layer 3 protocol type

#### - Class of service

#### - Router or switch interface

### NetFlow groups all packets with the same source/destination IP address, source/destination ports, protocol interface, and class of service into a flow; it then tallies the packets and bytes. Because a large amount of network information is condensed into a database of NetFlow information (the NetFlow cache), this method of fingerprinting or determining a flow is scalable.

---

## 3.4.1.F Network Behavior Analysis:

### - Network behavior analysis (NBA) is a technique used to monitor and analyze network traffic to detect anomalies or suspicious activity.

### - It involves collecting network traffic data, analyzing it for patterns and anomalies, and then taking appropriate action based on the analysis.

#### - Source address pinpoints the origin of the traffic.

#### - Destination address points out who is receiving the traffic.

#### - Ports characterize the application utilizing the traffic.

#### - Class of service examines the priority of the traffic.

#### - The device interface reveals how traffic is utilized by the network device.

#### - Tallied packets and bytes show the amount of traffic.

---

## 3.4.1.G Full Packet Capture:

### - Full packet capture (FPC) is a technique used to capture and analyze all the data in a network packet, including the header, payload, and any associated metadata.

### - It involves capturing the entire packet, including the source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocol types, and other relevant information.

### - FPC is used to capture and analyze network traffic for a variety of purposes, including network troubleshooting, security monitoring, and performance analysis.

### -Most, if not all, are not IDS or IPS systems. Additionally, they may not include the native ability to break encrypted transmissions such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) communications.

---

## 3.4.1.H Incident Detection:

### - Incident detection is the process of identifying and responding to security incidents in real-time.

### - It involves monitoring network traffic, system logs, and other sources of data to detect suspicious activity or potential threats.

### - Incident detection is a critical component of an organization's overall security strategy, helping to protect against cyber attacks and other security threats.

---

## 3.4.1.I Monitoring: Strategies, tactical , and operational:

### -Strategic. These are high-leverage and typically high-value opportunities, objectives, and goals, normally involving time frames of months to years.

### - Tactical. This is the middleware of planning and decision-making, where objectives turn into plans and timeframes become more granular.

### - Operational. This is the step-by-step use of tools, processes, and technologies to create value by carrying out business processes, such as manufacturing, sales or service delivery.

### - Passive monitoring

### - Active monitoring

### - Network-based monitoring

### - Host-based monitoring

### - Cloud-based monitoring

#### - Log protection from creation to disposition (archiving or defensible destruction)

#### - Log review, analytics, and reporting

---

## 3.4.1.K Continuous Monitoring:

### - Continuous monitoring is a process that involves monitoring an organization's systems and networks on a regular basis to detect and respond to security threats.

### - It involves collecting data from various sources, analyzing it for patterns and anomalies, and then taking appropriate action based on the analysis.

### - Continuous monitoring is a critical component of an organization's overall security strategy, helping to protect against cyber attacks and other security threats.

### - Several tools are available to help monitor the environment and respond quickly to threats and risks.

### - These include Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems like **Splunk** and **Sumo Logic**, as well as network monitoring tools like **SolarWinds**.

### - These tools provide visibility into organizational activities and changes, allowing for proactive issue management and maintaining a strong security posture.

---

## 3.4.1.L Changes in risks:

### - short list of the major driving forces that can change (or completely invalidate) a current estimation of risk (a risk posture) might include:

#### - Changes in the underlying technologies being used

#### - Political, legislative, or social changes

#### - Fresh opportunities for cybercriminals to pursue new purposes and objectives

#### - Rapid adoption and expanded use of new technologies by organizations, with insufficient IT and security talent to support and secure them

#### - Rapid adoption of revolutionary technologies by attackers long before they are available as stable commercial products or services

#### - Newly discovered exploits for previously identified vulnerabilities that were thought to have been fixed by patches, updates, or other changes

---

## 3.4.1.M Changes in risks:

### - Asset Value:

#### - Risk assessment was influenced by impact, and impact is based on the value of the asset affected by the risk event.

#### - As asset values change, so does the level of impact change. A system that may have been critically important a few years ago may now be at end of life, while a new system has increased in value to the organization.

#### - Remember that we base the level of impact of an IT outage on the business, not just on the impact on the IT department. This means that controls that were not justifiable when the system was just a minor system a few years ago are now essential and should be implemented as soon as possible.

---

## 3.4.1.O Trigger a New Risk Assessment:

### - Merger or acquisition of or by another organization

### - Reengineering of processes, business logic, or the organization

### - New business processes

### - New laws

### - New threats

### - Time

---

## 3.4.2 Events of interest:

### - An event of interest can be defined as an event associated with an IT or OT system that may be a security concern. Such events of interest include:

#### - Unscheduled or unanticipated shutdowns of servers, endpoints, or links

#### - Access attempts by a user (subject) to an app or other resources (objects) they normally do not use

#### - Self-service identity management requests for significantly different privileges normally associated with a subject

#### - Connection attempts from new devices, IP addresses, or regions

#### - Alarms, indicators, or signals from HVAC, power conditioning, or other infrastructure systems

#### - An app consuming or requesting substantial amounts of CPU, GPU, RAM, or other systems resources

#### - A physical access control device signaling repeated retries at entry or exit

#### - Unusual movement of files or other data flows across network links

#### - Attempts to install apps or repair applications that have been installed

#### - Large numbers of online retail orders being submitted, cancelled, disputed, or otherwise requiring customer service follow-up action

---

## 3.4.2.A Incident(event) triage:

### - An event of interest can be defined as an event associated with an IT or OT system that may be a security concern. Such events of interest include:

---

## 3.4.2.B Monitoring control:

### Monitoring control deployment considerations should include:

#### - Choosing one or more monitoring technique types such as host intrusion detection systems (HIDS), network intrusion detection system (NIDS), logging

#### - Choosing an analysis paradigm such as statistical anomaly, signature

#### - Choosing a system that meets timeliness objectives such as real time or scheduled (non-real time)

#### - Choosing a reporting mechanism for incident response such as push or pull (i.e., does a management system query the monitoring devices for data or does the device push the data to a repository where it is stored or analyzed?)

#### - Making update mechanisms part of policy with well-defined procedures, especially for signature-based devices

#### - Tuning monitoring systems to reflect the environment they support

#### - Choosing automatic response mechanisms wisely

### Maintaining/Configuring/Managing a monitoring system:

#### Maintenance and tuning. For the long-term use and effectiveness of the monitoring controls, systems should be cared for like any other mission-critical component.

#### Keep IDS signatures current (if applicable).

#### Signature-based IDS must be kept up to date as previously unknown vulnerabilities are revealed.

#### Keep IDS subsystems current.

#### As new generations of IDS subsystems (the operating systems and software engines that drive the system) become available, consider testing then deploying these to know whether they add to the capability of detecting exploits, but do not introduce instability.

#### Tune IDS. NIDS systems have limitations on how much processing they can handle; therefore, limit what the NIDS must monitor based on your environment. For example, if you do not have Windows-based hosts, consider disabling monitoring for Windows-based exploits. Conversely, if you have a UNIX environment and UNIX-based signatures are not enabled, you will likely miss these events.

---

## 3.4.2.C Collecting Data for incident response:

### Establishing an evidence custody storage facility and associated processes to enter evidence of any kind into custody.

### Incident response process workflows, including data triage, that can properly route indicators and supporting data to evidence custody.

---

## 3.4.2.D Monitoring response techniques:

### Passive response. This response notes (e.g., through records, logs) the event at various levels but does not take any type of evasive action. The response is, by definition, passive because the event is merely noted.

### Active response. This notes the event and performs a reaction to protect systems from further exploitation.

### Examples of passive IDS/IPS response:

#### - Logging the event to a log file

#### - Displaying an alert on the console of an event viewer or security information management system

#### - Logging the details of a packet flow that was identified to be associated with an unauthorized event for a specified period for the purpose of subsequent forensic analysis

#### - Sending an alert page, text message, or email to an administrator

### Examples of active IDS/IPS response:

#### - Blocking the source IP address

#### - Sending an alert page, text message, or email to an administrator

#### - Disabling the network interface card (NIC)

#### - Sending an alert page, text message, or email to an administrator

#### - Initiate a NIDS to reset the connection with a TCP reset between an attacker and the host being attacked.

#### - Initiate a NIDS and instruct a filtering device such as a firewall or router to dynamically alter its access control list (ACL) and preclude further communications with the attacker, either indefinitely or for a specified period.

#### - Initiate the HIDS agent to block the transaction.

#### - With TCP resets, often the IDS will send a TCP packet with the FIN (finish) flag set in the TCP header to both the attacker and the attacked hosts to reset the connection from both hosts’ perspective. By resetting the attacker, this discourages future attacks if they keep getting resets. By resetting the attacked host, this frees up system resources that may have been allocated because of the attack.

#### - With system calls, if a process that does not normally need to access the web server’s data tries to access the data, the HIDS agent can disallow this access.

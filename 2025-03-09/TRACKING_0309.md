## 2. Study Priorities

Based on the frequency of missed questions, hereâ€™s a prioritized study plan (1 = High priority, 3 = Low priority):

| **Domain**                                   | **Priority Level** | **Reasoning**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Domain 5: Security Operations & Admin        | 1 (High)           | Most missed questions (DRP, BCP, job rotation, physical security, backups).   |
| Domain 6: Security Assessment & Testing      | 1 (High)           | Multiple misses on penetration testing, auditing, and vulnerability assessments. |
| Domain 1: Access Controls                    | 2 (Medium)         | Several errors on authentication, SSO, and RBAC.                             |
| Domain 7: Systems & Application Security     | 2 (Medium)         | Weak areas in secure software dev, database security, and intrusion detection. |
| Domain 4: Network & Communications Security  | 3 (Low-Medium)     | A few mistakes on IPsec, network addressing, and cabling.                    |
| Domain 3: Risk Identification & Monitoring  | 3 (Low-Medium)     | Struggles with cryptography, risk modeling, and CMM.                         |
| Domain 2: Security Operations & Admin        | 3 (Low)            | Fewer errors, mostly buffer overflows and coding issues.                     |

### ðŸ“Œ Recommended Study Order
1. **High Priority**: Security Operations & Admin (Domain 5) and Security Assessment & Testing (Domain 6)  
2. **Medium Priority**: Access Controls (Domain 1) and Systems & Application Security (Domain 7)  
3. **Low Priority**: Network & Communications (Domain 4), Risk Identification (Domain 3), and Security Ops (Domain 2)

## Final Steps
1. **Study High-Priority Topics First**: Focus on Domains 5 and 6 to address the bulk of your weaknesses.  
2. **Leverage Resources**: Watch recommended videos and read articles to solidify concepts.  
3. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: Take targeted practice tests on your weak areas to track improvement.  

Good luck on your SSCP journey! ðŸš€

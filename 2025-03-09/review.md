• Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines
NIST develops and issues standards, guidelines, and other publications to assist federal agencies in
implementing the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and in managing cost-
effective programs to protect their information and information systems.
• Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are developed by NIST in accordance with
FISMA. FIPS are approved by the Secretary of Commerce and are compulsory and binding for
federal agencies. Since FISMA requires that federal agencies comply with these standards,
agencies may not waive their use.

## Contingency Planning and Resilience

- Confidentiality(機密性): preserves authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including
  means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.
  - Integrity（可信性）: guards against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring
  information non-repudiation and authenticity

- Availability(可使用性): ensures timely and reliable access to and use of information.

2.2.1 Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

- The BCP focuses on sustaining an organization’s mission/business processes during and after a
  disruption.
- An example of a mission/business process may be an organization’s payroll process or
  customer service process.
- A BCP may be written for mission/business processes within a single business
  unit or may address the entire organization’s processes.
- The BCP may also be scoped to address only the
  functions deemed to be priorities.
- A BCP may be used for long-term recovery in conjunction with the
  COOP plan, allowing for additional functions to come online as resources or time allow. Because
  mission/business processes use information systems (ISs), the business continuity planner must
  coordinate with information system owners to ensure that the BCP expectations and IS capabilities are
  matched.

  2.2.2 Continuity of Operations (COOP) Plan
  COOP focuses on restoring an organization’s mission essential functions (MEF) at an alternate site and
  performing those functions for up to 30 days before returning to normal operations. Additional functions,
  or those at a field office level, may be addressed by a BCP. Minor threats or disruptions that do not
  require relocation to an alternate site are typically not addressed in a COOP plan.
  Standard elements of a COOP plan include:
   Program plans and procedures  Continuity communications
   Risk management  Vital records management
   Budgeting and acquisition of resources  Human capital
   Essential functions  Test, training, and exercise
   Order of succession  Devolution
   Delegation of authority  Reconstitution
  Continuity facilities

From Confusion to Clarity: A High School Student's Journey with Life Design Counseling

For a sixteen-year-old, the future can feel like a room with a single, locked door. The choice she faced was the key, and the pressure to turn it correctly was immense. As a first-year high school student, she had to select one foundational subject from physics and history, and then choose two more from a list including chemistry, biology, and politics. This wasn't just a scheduling decision; it was a moment of acute identity crisis, pitting her father's practical ambitions against her own nascent passions for writing and law. Her story is a powerful example of how Life Design Counseling helps a student not just pick a key, but design their own door.

1. The Crossroads of Choice: A Portrait of Indecision

The student's primary conflict was a classic battle between external expectations and internal passions. Her father, practical and forward-thinking, strongly advocated for physics, seeing it as the gateway to a stable career and better employment prospects. However, her heart was drawn to the world of words and justice; she dreamed of becoming a writer or a lawyer, pursuits that would require her to choose history.

This tension left her in a state of scattered interests and indecisiveness. Her vision for the future was a hazy collection of abstract desires, lacking focus and a concrete foundation. This initial confusion is vividly captured in her pre-counseling "Future Career Autobiography," an exercise designed to map out one's life goals. Her entire entry was just 11 words long:

"I want to be a famous writer or a musician, and my parents are well."

This brief statement reflected a vague and underdeveloped vision, a dream untethered to reality. It was clear she needed a new way to navigate her thoughts, and Life Design Counseling (LDC) would provide her with the map and compass to do so.

2. The First Conversation: Uncovering the Narrative Threads

The first counseling session was not about making a decision; it was about discovery. The counselor used the Career Construction Interview (CCI), a structured conversation designed to help individuals find the core themes and values hidden within their own life stories. This process was a collaborative exploration, a way to uncover the narrative threads that defined who she was and what truly mattered to her.

Several key insights emerged, painting a clearer picture of her inner world:

* Role Models: She admired her father's perseverance, a classmate's kindness, and a pop star's dedication to teamwork. The CCI process revealed that these were not just admirable qualities in others; they were the core components of her own unarticulated identity—the person she aspired to become. The counselor's role was to hold up a mirror to these scattered reflections so she could see a coherent image for the first time.
* Preferred Environment: Her interest in light novels and the TV show Running Man pointed to her preference for a relaxed, cohesive, and text-related work environment where people worked together toward a common goal.
* Personal Script: Her favorite story was The Soulmate, a narrative about profound dedication between friends. This revealed her personal script for relationships: one centered on loyalty and righteousness.
* Guiding Motto: Her personal motto—that success is "99% hard work plus one percent talent"—served as her personal action guide, a testament to her belief in effort and determination.
* Core Memory: One of her earliest recollections was of a kindergarten teacher gifting her an encyclopedia. This single event, a foundational memory she titled "the gift of childhood," was the origin point of her deep-seated love for reading and writing.

By the end of the first session, these seemingly random facts about her life were no longer just disconnected details. They were the raw materials that would be woven together to form a coherent self-portrait in the next session.

3. The Turning Point: Assembling the Life Portrait

The second session's goal was to integrate the narrative threads from her past with her hopes for the future, assembling them into a cohesive "life portrait." It was during this process that a pivotal conflict came into sharp focus. The student recognized a significant mismatch between her stated career interests (writer, lawyer) and her desired work environment, which she described as "hilarious" and collaborative.

This realization led to the critical breakthrough of the entire counseling process: the reframing of her problem. This was the essential pivot of Life Design. By reframing the vague, existential dread of "career choice" into the concrete, solvable problem of "improving my math grade," the counseling shifted her from a state of passive anxiety to one of active agency. Her true obstacle wasn't indecision, but a lack of career confidence rooted in her avoidance of mathematics and her fear of asking her teacher for help. It gave her a tangible starting point, demonstrating that a fulfilling future is not found, but built, one manageable step at a time.

This new understanding shifted the focus entirely, moving the conversation away from abstract self-discovery and toward creating a concrete plan of action.

4. Designing the Future: From Abstract Goals to Concrete Actions

The third session was dedicated to co-construction and action. With the counselor's help, the student used her newly assembled "life portrait" to build a practical path forward. Her perspective had fundamentally shifted. She now understood that she didn't need to solve her entire future at once. Instead, her "career problem" would be solved by tackling the "real problem": improving her mathematics grade.

This insight was transformative. It turned a vague, overwhelming dilemma into a specific, manageable goal. The awareness translated directly into behavioral change. She became more attentive in math class and, for the first time, found the courage to approach her teacher with questions. She had moved from passive confusion to proactive engagement, ready to write a new, more confident chapter of her life.

5. A New Chapter: The Tangible Transformation

The success of the Life Design Counseling was not just a feeling; it was measurable. The transformation was evident in her written narratives, her mindset, and her overall confidence in navigating her future.

Narrative Shift: Future Career Autobiography (FCA)

Her written vision for the future evolved dramatically, shifting from "vagueness to focus" and "fixation to openness." Her narrative expression expanded significantly, growing from just 11 words to 45 words. Her goals were now specific, sequenced, and grounded in personal effort.

Before Counseling	After Counseling
"I want to be a famous writer or a musician, and my parents are well."	"After my job is stable, I will buy a car and a house mainly by my efforts, and after I settle down with my parents, I will write a book when I am 27 and start a family when I am 30 years old."

Mindset Shift: Innovative Moments (IMCS)

The Innovative Moments Coding System (IMCS) is a tool used by counselors to track shifts in a client's thinking, from being stuck in the problem to envisioning change. The evolution in her responses below reveals a powerful cognitive restructuring:

Question	Pre-Test Response	Post-Test Response
What are the main obstacles you encounter?	Abstract fears about the future being difficult and losing hope.	The "Mathematics subject."
Who do you think has been helpful to you?	"Teachers"	"Myself"
What are the main goals you hope you can achieve?	"Improve my writing skills and have a successful entrance exam."	"Rising performance in mathematics and top 100 overall grade level."

This shift from citing "Teachers" to "Myself" as the helpful agent is perhaps the most telling indicator of her growth. It represents a fundamental shift in her locus of control—from external to internal. She no longer saw herself as a passive recipient of help but as the primary author of her own success.

Finally, her scores on the Career Adapt-Abilities Scale showed a significant improvement across all four dimensions, indicating a profound increase in her psychological resources for managing her future:

* Concern: She now believed her future was worth preparing for.
* Control: She recognized that she was responsible for constructing her own career.
* Curiosity: She became more willing to explore her options and herself.
* Confidence: She developed self-efficacy and the belief that she could overcome difficulties.

She was no longer a passive passenger in her life; she felt empowered to be the architect of her own future.

6. Conclusion: Key Insights from the Story

This student's journey is more than a success story; it's a microcosm of the life design process itself, offering profound lessons for anyone guiding a young person through uncertainty. First, it highlights the power of narrative. Exploring one's personal story through the Career Construction Interview uncovers the core values and interests that can serve as an authentic guide for career decisions. Second, it demonstrates the critical importance of reframing the problem. By transforming a vague, overwhelming "career problem" into a specific, actionable challenge—like improving a math grade—counseling empowers real, tangible change. Ultimately, this case illustrates that the goal of Life Design Counseling is not merely to provide answers, but to build adaptability. True success lies not in choosing the "right" subject, but in developing the confidence, curiosity, and skills to navigate future transitions and construct a meaningful life, one step at a time.

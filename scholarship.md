Home International Scholarships Presented by MyUS.com Leadership & Global Perspectives Scholarship
The MyUS.com Global Perspectives Scholarship
Scholarship Award: $2,500
Due date for this scholarship submission: November 30, 2025
colorful book binds on shelves
MyUS.com is pleased to offer our annual “Global Perspectives” scholarship – focused on the role of experiential learning in preparing global-ready graduates.

As an industry leader in international shipping and shopping, few organizations are more reliant on the desire for consumers and businesses to be globally interconnected than MyUS.com. Similarly, few global organizations better understand the transformative, impactful nature of breaking down boundaries, transcending cultures, and connecting the previously unconnected.

A study conducted by San Diego State University (SDSU), conveys that clear results are emerging on the impact of study abroad and international internships on the career development of international business students during the past decade and a half. The study asserts that, “solid evidence now supports the contention that students with an experiential international education compete more successfully than their peers in today’s global workforce.” The study goes on to state that, “international educators are now finding themselves equipped with solid empirical data to verify what they have always assumed to be true: learning in an international/intercultural setting not only transforms students’ lives, it clearly enhances their career development.”

A related study conducted by Rice University goes on to outline many of the characteristics students acquire during the course of an international program that makes them far more marketable to employers, from a global business perspective, following graduation. The study finds that students who study internationally are much more likely to be able to:

Creatively solve problems by applying familiar concepts to unfamiliar situations
Contribute to an ethnically diverse team
Be self-confident, yet able to listen and learn from people whose value systems are different
Take personal risks and act independently
Be flexible and adaptable to rapidly changing situations
Have a basic command of the local language, and be able use it in practical situations
Imagine, forecast, analyze or address business situations from a different cultural frame of reference.
As a global organization, MyUS.com has a growing, vested interest in preparing tomorrow’s future international business leaders for long-term success. As such, we invite all students who meet the criteria listed below to apply for this scholarship.

To qualify for scholarship consideration, eligible students must currently be completing academic courses in a country other than their home country (studying abroad or as an international student), have been accepted to a study abroad program or have studied abroad within the past two academic years. Students are required to write a 500-word essay detailing why they chose an international program, how they feel that program will enhance their studies (or did enhance their studies) and how they feel that program will likely impact their perspectives relative to other cultures and the impact that will have on future business successes. Additionally, the essay should clearly articulate how they believe their experience studying abroad will make them increasingly competitive in today’s global job market.
